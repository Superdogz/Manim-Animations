# Manim-Animations
Manim Public Library must be installed for this to work. Manim requires versions 3.8 to 3.11 to run. All preloaded files are included in the media file.

Run the desired file using the command: manim -pqh *File_path* *Scene*
Replace Scene with the scene name. Replace File_path with the path of the script file. (ex. manim -pqh PS4/script.py Body)
