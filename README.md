# Manim-Animations
Manim Public Libary must be instaled for this to work. Manim requires versions 3.8 to 3.11 to run. All preloaded files are included in the media file.

Run the desired file using the command: manim -pqh *File_path* *Scene*
Replace Scene with the scene name. Replace File_path with the path of the script file. (ex. manim -pqh PS4/script.py Body)
